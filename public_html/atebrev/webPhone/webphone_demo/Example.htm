<!-- 
  This is a simple example for the websipphone usage.
  You need to set at least the serveraddress applet parameter for this example to work (replace "YOURSIPDOMAIN.COM" with your VoIP server IP or domain name)
  Then copy this html file together with with the webphone.jar to your webserver. (Or you can just copy-paste the applet section whenever you wish into your existing html) 
  More/better examples can be found in the "Examples" folder, including html skins.
